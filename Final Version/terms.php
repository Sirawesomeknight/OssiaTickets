          <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
          <p>Last Updated: 8/25/2018

            The following are the terms of use ("Terms") that govern your use of the Warp10 sites and applications where this appears (collectively, the "Site"). Our Privacy Purchasing Policy and Privacy Policy are also incorporated into these Terms. By visiting or using the Site, you expressly agree to these Terms, as we may update them from time to time.
            We may make changes to these Terms at any time.  The changes will be effective immediately upon posting.  The "Last Updated" date above will tell you when these Terms were last revised. If you continue to use this Site after that date, you are expressly agreeing to the changes.
            This Site is not targeted at children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the Site.  If you use the Site, you affirm you are at least 13 years old.  We strongly believe that the use of the internet by children should be regularly monitored by parents and guardians and encourage such monitoring. You must be at least 18 years old to register for an account and must be able to enter into legally binding contracts to use the Site.
          </p>
          <h2>Account Registration</h2>
          <p>This Site may be accessed and browsed without registering for an account. However, in order to purchase a ticket, you must register for an account. In creating an account user name, it is critical that such account username not be obscene, offensive or vulgar. The user account name may not include the name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person. Your account username and password are personal to you. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and use of your username and password.  You are also responsible for all activities (including purchases) that are conducted through your account. You are prohibited from transferring or selling access to your account. We will not be liable for any harm related to disclosure of your username or password or the use by anyone else of your username or password. You are prohibited from using any other user's account without that user's permission and we discourage any such use. If you discover any unauthorized use of your account or other account-related security breach, you must immediately notify us in writing. We may require you to change your username and/or password if we believe your account is no longer secure or if we receive a complaint that your username violates someone else's rights or that we deem inappropriate in our discretion. We reserve the right to refuse registration, cancel an account or deny access to the Site for any reason. You acknowledge that you have no ownership in your account or your username.
