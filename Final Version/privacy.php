        <div id="privacy">
          <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
          <p>This Privacy policy (the “Policy”) applies to our site and apps. This Policy outlines how we treat the
            personal information we collect both online and offline. This includes on our websites and in our apps. It will
            also cover any email correspondence we may have.
            Information collected from you. There are many types of information that we collect in order to provide
            our services. Such information includes:
            Payment and billing information. We collect your credit card number, billing address and zip code when you buy a
            ticket.
            Contact information. We may also collect your phone number or email.
            Demographic information. We may seek to collect information about your age range, race, or gender or information
            about events you like or products you buy.
            Other information. We have the ability to look at what site you came from if you use our website and the site you go
            to when you leave our site. This enables us to collect information about the browser you&#39;re using. We may collect
            information about your location including your precise location. We may collect this using technology such as GPS
            and Wi-Fi. If you use our mobile app, we may also access your device&#39;s location in the background. We may collect
            your device&#39;s unique identifier. We might also collect the type of mobile device you are using, or the version of the
            operating system your computer or device is running. We might look at how often you use the app and where you
            downloaded it.</p>
            <h2>Ways we collect information</h2>
            <p>Directly from you. For example, if you register for a promotion or buy tickets. We also collect information if you post
              a comment on our websites or ask us a question.
              Through tracking tools. We can use tracking tools like web beacons and browser cookies. We also collect
              information from our mobile apps.
              From third parties. We may have access to data from the third-party social media site which will give us certain
              information about you. This could include your name and email address. Also, your activities on our sites and apps
              may be posted to the social media platforms.
              We use this information.
              We use information to respond to your requests or questions. We might use your information to confirm your
              registration for an event or contest. We also might use your information to customize your experience with us. This
              could include using your preferences to determine what content is displayed to you. We keep personal information as
              long as it is necessary or relevant for our business, which may include using it to resolve disputes, enforce our
              agreements and otherwise required by law.
              We use information to look at customer interests. We may use your information to improve our website products.
              We may combine information we get from you with information about you we get from third parties.
              We use information for security purposes. We may use information we have collected to protect our company,
              our customers, or our websites.
              We use information for marketing purposes. We may send you information about special promotions or offers. We
              might also tell you about new features or products. These might be our own offers or products, or third-party offers or
              products we think you might find interesting.
              We may also use push notifications on our mobile apps. We may use push notifications and your location
              information on our mobile apps to send you alerts regarding local events.
              We use information to send you transactional communications. We may send you emails about a ticket
              purchase or your account or about this policy or our website terms.

              We use information as otherwise permitted by law or as we may notify you.</p>
            </h2>We may share information with third parties.</h2>
            <p>We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, we may work
              with third parties who support our registration and purchase fulfillment functions. This would require sharing your
              information with such vendors. Some vendors may be located outside of the United States.
              We will share information with our business partners. This includes a third party who provides or sponsors an
              event, or who operates a venue where we hold events. Our partners use the information we give them as described
              in their privacy policies, which may include sending you marketing communications. You should read those polices to
              learn how they treat your information.
              We may share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For
              example, we may also share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests we will share information or to
              respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also share information with third parties in order to help in any
              internal investigations we deem relevant (for instance if we think a fraud has been committed during a promotion).
              We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. If all or a part of our business is
              sold, it is likely that we will provide our customer list as part of that transaction.
              We may share your information for reasons not described in this policy. We will tell you before we do this
              unless notification is not required by law.</p>
              <h2>What you can do about your information.</h2>
              <p>You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails. To stop receiving our promotional emails, clickhere or follow
                the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. Your device settings should provide you with
                instructions on how to turn off push notifications. It may take about ten days to process your request. If you opt out of
                marketing emails, you will still get emails related to any purchases you may make, and we will still contact you about
                your orders.
                You can modify information you have given us. To delete or correct information or update account settings, log
                into your account and follow the instructions. We make changes as soon as we can. The prior information may stay in
                our backup files during such time as we keep these files. If we cannot make the changes you want, we will let you
                know and explain why. If you contact us requesting access to your information, we will respond within 30 days.
                You can control cookies and tracking tools. To learn how to manage how we - and our vendors - use cookies and
                other tracking tools, please clickhere.
                You can control tools on your mobile devices. For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications
                on your phone. Each push notification has an &quot;unsubscribe&quot; link.
