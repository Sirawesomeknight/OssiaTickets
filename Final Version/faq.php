            <h2>How does Ossia work?</h2>
            <p>Ossia is a true ticket exchange which means that we are a marketplace for both buyers and sellers unlike our competitors which are just marketplaces for buyers. Buyers input how much they want to pay and Sellers input how much they want to sell for and then we come in and match up Buyers and Sellers.</p>

            <h2>I have a fraudulent ticket! What should I do?</h2>
            <p>If you receive a fraudulent ticket please contact us as soon as possible at either 1-(773)-750-6005 or tickets@ossiatickets.com. The more information you provide us regarding the order the easier it will be for us to help you. After an event ends, you only have 24 hours to report a fraudulent ticket after this period passes we can no longer help you.</p>

          <div id="faqbox">
            <h2>Why is the event I want to buy tickets for not listed?</h2>
            <p>Sadly, at the current time Ossia is unable to facilitate the transaction of tickets in all the cities in the U.S. this is something we are working on. If there is a event you want to buy tickets for in a city that we do events for than please contact us at either  1-(773)-750-6005 or tickets@ossiatickets.com</p>

          <div id="faqbox">
            <h2>How soon will I get my ticket?</h2>
            <p>If you've opted to receive the ticket by mail, you can expect to receive a separate email containing all relevant information. In the case of online deliveries, you are guaranteed to receive your tickets before the event. If you have opted to pick up your ticket in person, then you will receive an email at least 48 hours before the event, with the relevant pick up time and location.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once your order is completed you will receive your ticket in either 5-7 days, 2-4 days or 2 days depending on which option you choose for shipping when you submitted your order. You will receive and email when your order is completed telling you when to expect your tickets. If you have any questions about this please contact us at either  1-(773)-750-6005 or tickets@ossiatickets.com.</p>

          <div id="faqbox">
            <h2>When will I get paid as a seller?</h2>
            <p>In order to make sure tickets aren’t fraudulent, we ask that all sellers wait until 72 hours after the concert to be paid. As long as you have received email confirmation from us that your ticket has been sold, you are guaranteed compensation. When your ticket is sold your will receive an email confirmation from us and then you will receive payment for your ticket 72 hours after the concert. This is to allow us to verify if the ticket you sold was fraudulent. If you believe an error was made in regards to your payment please contact us at either 1-(773)-750-6005 or tickets@ossiatickets.com</p>

            <h2>Can I buy more than the maximum quantity (10) of tickets?</h2>
